## Technologies Used
List the main technologies, libraries, and frameworks used in your project.

- Flask
- Flask-PyMongo
- pandas
- dotenv (for environment variables)
- MongoDB (database)

## Installation
1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-project.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd your-project
   ```
3. Install the required dependencies using pip:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your MongoDB URI in the following format:
   ```
   MONGO_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/yourdatabase
   ```

## Running the Application
1. Make sure your MongoDB server is running.
2. Run the Flask application:
   ```
   python app.py
   ```
3. Access the application in your web browser at `http://localhost:5000/`.

## MongoDB Setup
Ensure that MongoDB is installed and running on your local machine or a remote server.

## Flask Application Structure
- `app.py`: Main Flask application file containing routes and logic.
- `templates/`: Directory containing HTML templates for rendering.
- `static/`: Directory for static files such as CSS, JavaScript, and images.

## Data Processing and MongoDB Interaction
The Flask application processes user-submitted data, performs data processing using pandas, and interacts with MongoDB for data storage and retrieval.

## Troubleshooting and Debugging
- Check the Flask application logs for errors and debug information.
- Verify the MongoDB URI in the `.env` file is correctly set.
- Ensure that MongoDB collections match the configurations in the Flask application.
